# Let's Read Stuff

This is a charter document for the discord server "Let's read stuff" - I'll keep it on github so that we can version control and "vote" on changes to our charter.

### Rules
1. Good vibes
1. Let's try to meet weekly?
1. Anyone can edit this directly for now, PRs are more of a nice to have if we're discussing stuff
1. Invite your friends!
1. Read stuff
